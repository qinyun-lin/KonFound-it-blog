      <title>First example: Pneumonia finding from initial hydroxychloroquine RCT only requires 1 ‘switch’ to invalidate</title>

      <description>The first report of a randomized trial regarding hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) came from a study conducted at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The table below shows the association between treatment (HCQ vs conventional) and condition (improved vs exacerbated/ucnhanged). For Table 1, \(χ^2= 4.7\), \(p = 0.03\), and the authors concluded that HCQ was efficacious.&#xA;Table 1. Association between hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) vs Conventional Treatments and Pneumonia on Chest CT&#xA;To quantify the robustness of the inference, we calculate the number of treatment cases that would need to be switched from “improved” to “exacerbated or unchanged” to change the inference – a quantity we refer to as the Robustness of the Inference to Switches (RIS).</description>

      <title>From early RCT: effect of Remdesivir on mortality could go either way</title>

      <description>Consider the recent randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19. The study found no discernable difference in mortality: Twenty-two of \(158\) (\(14\%\)) Remdesivir patients died within \(28\) days while \(10\) of \(78\) (\(13\%\)) in the placebo group died (Table 1). How different would the results have to be in the current study to change statistical inference about Remdesivir?&#xA;Table 1. Comparison of Remdesivir vs Placebo Control on Mortality.</description>

      <title>From early RCT: robust inference of Remdesivir effect on time to clinical improvement</title>

      <description>Now consider the previous example of Remdesivir but instead we are interested in the continuous outcome variable of time to clinical improvement.&#xA;Figure 1. Time to clinical improvement in the Remdesivir example. Data from Table 3, Wang et al (2020).&#xA;We can interpret the robustness of inference regarding Remdesivir’s effect on time to clinical improvement in following ways.&#xA;Percent bias necessary to invalidate the inference To invalidate an inference, \(70.</description>

      <description>Online dashboards, such as the COVID-19 clinical trials registry, provide near real-time tracking and categorization of findings accumulating across emerging research. As such one can update the robustness of the cumulative findings for a given COVID-19 treatment. We illustrate using a historical non-COVID example: the study-by-study accumulation of \(16\) estimated effects presented in a meta-analysis of randomized trials examining the impact of hypertension treatments on the probability of suffering a stroke (data from Collins et al.</description>
